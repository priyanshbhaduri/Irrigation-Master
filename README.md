 Irrigation Master is an advanced, microcontroller-based automated irrigation system designed to optimize water usage and maintain ideal soil moisture levels across multiple plant types. The system is powered by an Arduino Uno, which continuously samples analog data from capacitive soil moisture sensors interfaced through its ADC channels.
